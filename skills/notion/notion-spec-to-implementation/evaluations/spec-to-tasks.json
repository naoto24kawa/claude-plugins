    "Step 6: Fetches Tasks database using Notion:notion-fetch to get schema, property names, and data sources",
    "Step 7: Identifies correct data source from <data-source> tags in fetch results",
    "Step 8: Optionally creates implementation plan page first (recommended per workflow)",
    "Step 9: For each task - creates task page using Notion:notion-create-pages with parent: { data_source_id: 'collection://...' }",

    "Step 11: Includes task description with context, acceptance criteria from spec, dependencies",
    "Step 12: Links tasks to spec page using <mention-page> and to each other for dependencies",
    "Step 13: Sequences tasks appropriately (setup → implementation → testing per reference/task-creation.md)",

    "Multiple tasks created (at least 3-5) covering spec scope",
