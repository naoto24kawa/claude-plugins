    "Step 1: Uses Notion:notion-search to find 'User Authentication spec' with keywords like 'User Authentication' or 'auth spec'",
    "Step 2: If not found or ambiguous, asks user for spec page URL/ID",
    "Step 3: Fetches spec page using Notion:notion-fetch with URL/ID from search results",
    "Step 4: Parses spec using patterns from reference/spec-parsing.md to extract requirements, acceptance criteria, constraints",
    "Step 5: Identifies functional requirements (user stories, features, workflows) and non-functional requirements (performance, security)",
    "Step 6: Creates implementation plan following structure from reference/templates.md",
    "Step 7: Includes sections: Overview, Linked Spec, Requirements Summary, Technical Approach, Implementation Phases",
    "Step 8: Breaks work into logical phases with Goal, Tasks checklist, Estimated effort per phase",
    "Step 9: Identifies dependencies and risks from spec content",
    "Step 10: Links plan back to original spec page using <mention-page url='...'>",
    "Step 11: Creates plan page using Notion:notion-create-pages with appropriate title (e.g., 'Implementation Plan: User Authentication')",
    "Step 12: Places plan appropriately (asks user or suggests under project/spec parent)"
  ],
  "success_criteria": [
    "Spec is found using Notion:notion-search before attempting to fetch (or user is asked for URL if not found)",
    "Spec is fetched using Notion:notion-fetch with correct URL/ID from search results",
    "Plan includes clear overview and spec link with mention-page tag",
    "Requirements are extracted from actual spec content (not generic) using spec-parsing patterns",
    "Work is broken into multiple phases (typically 3-5) following template structure",
    "Each phase has Goal, Tasks (as checkboxes), and Estimated effort",
    "Dependencies and risks sections are included with specific details from spec",
    "Plan follows Implementation Plan structure from reference/templates.md",
    "Success criteria or acceptance criteria from spec are referenced in plan",
    "Uses correct tool names and sequence: Notion:notion-search → Notion:notion-fetch → Notion:notion-create-pages"
