**Timeline**: [Status vs original plan]

**Risks**: [Top 1-2 risks]

**Next Milestone**: [Upcoming milestone and date]
```

## Automated Progress Tracking

### Query-Based Status

Generate status from task database:

```
Query task database:
SELECT 
  "Status",
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM "collection://tasks-uuid"
WHERE "Related Tasks" CONTAINS 'plan-page-id'
GROUP BY "Status"

Generate summary:
- To Do: 8
- In Progress: 5
- Blocked: 1
- In Review: 2
- Done: 12

Overall: 44% complete (12/28 tasks)
```

### Timeline Calculation

Calculate projected completion:

```
Average velocity: 6 tasks/week
Remaining tasks: 14
Projected completion: 2.3 weeks from now

Compares to target: [On schedule/Behind/Ahead]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Update regularly**: Don't let updates pile up
2. **Be specific**: "Completed login" vs "Made progress"
3. **Quantify progress**: Use percentages, counts, metrics
4. **Note blockers immediately**: Don't wait to report blockers
5. **Link to work**: Reference PRs, deployments, demos
6. **Track decisions**: Document why, not just what
7. **Be honest**: Report actual status, not optimistic status
8. **Update in one place**: Keep implementation plan as source of truth
