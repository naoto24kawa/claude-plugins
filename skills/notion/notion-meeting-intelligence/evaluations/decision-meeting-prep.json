  "expected_behavior": [
    "Step 1: Uses Notion:notion-search to find context about database migration (project pages, technical specs, previous discussions, options analysis)",
    "Step 2: Fetches at least 2-3 relevant pages using Notion:notion-fetch to gather information from Notion",
    "Step 3: Identifies the decision to be made and available options from fetched Notion content",
    "Step 4: Enriches with Claude research - adds decision-making frameworks (e.g., cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment), technical context for migration approaches, best practices for database migrations",
    "Step 5: Distinguishes Notion facts from Claude insights in synthesis",
    "Step 6: Creates INTERNAL PRE-READ using Notion:notion-create-pages with title like 'INTERNAL: Database Migration Decision - Pre-Read - [Date]'",
    "Step 6a: Internal pre-read includes: Meeting overview, background context (from Notion), current status and technical details, context & insights (from Claude research on migration best practices), decision options with detailed pros/cons, recommendation with rationale, what we need from meeting",
    "Step 6b: Internal pre-read marked clearly as 'INTERNAL ONLY' or 'For team only'",
    "Step 7: Creates EXTERNAL AGENDA using Notion:notion-create-pages with title like 'Meeting Agenda: Database Migration Decision - [Date]'",
    "Step 7a: External agenda includes: Meeting details, objective (clear decision to make), agenda items with time allocations, discussion topics, decisions needed, action items section (empty), related resources with link to pre-read",
    "Step 7b: External agenda is clean, professional, focused (no internal strategy or detailed pros/cons)",
    "Step 8: Links both documents together (agenda mentions pre-read, pre-read mentions agenda)",
    "Both documents link to source pages using <mention-page url='...'>"

  "success_criteria": [
    "TWO documents are created (internal pre-read + external agenda), not just one",
    "Internal pre-read is comprehensive with: Notion context + Claude insights + detailed pros/cons + recommendation",
    "Internal pre-read is clearly marked 'INTERNAL' or 'For team only'",
    "External agenda is professional, structured, focused on meeting flow (not internal strategy)",
    "Claude enrichment is present and adds value (decision frameworks, migration best practices, risk patterns)",
    "Notion facts are clearly sourced, Claude insights are distinguished",
    "At least 2-3 Notion source pages are cited using mention-page tags",
    "Internal pre-read follows structure from SKILL.md Step 5 (Meeting Overview → Background → Current Status → Context & Insights → Key Discussion Points → What We Need)",
    "External agenda follows structure from SKILL.md Step 6 (Meeting Details → Objective → Agenda Items → Discussion Topics → Decisions Needed → Action Items → Related Resources)",
    "Documents are cross-linked (pre-read mentions agenda, agenda mentions pre-read)",
    "Meeting date is included in both titles",
