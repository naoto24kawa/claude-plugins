# Architecture Decision: Database Migration Strategy

## Meeting Details
**Date & Time**: October 15, 2025 at 2:00 PM  
**Duration**: 90 minutes  
**Location**: Conference Room B / Zoom  
**Facilitator**: Sarah Chen (Engineering Lead)  
**Attendees**:
- Sarah Chen (Engineering Lead)
- David Kim (CTO)
- Alice Wang (Backend Team Lead)
- Bob Martinez (DevOps Lead)
- Carol Johnson (Product Director)

## Pre-Read Summary

### Background

Our MongoDB database is experiencing performance degradation as we scale. Query response times have increased from 50ms to 400ms average over the past 6 months. The schema-less nature that initially provided flexibility is now causing data consistency issues and making application logic more complex.

**Source**: <mention-page url="...">Current Database Performance Issues</mention-page>

### Current Situation

**Performance metrics**:
- Average query time: 400ms (was 50ms 6 months ago)
- p95 query time: 1.2s (was 200ms)
- Database size: 500GB (growing 20GB/month)
- Connection pool exhaustion during peak traffic

**Technical debt**:
- 15+ application-layer validation rules compensating for lack of schema
- Complex data migration scripts for schema changes
- Limited transaction support causing race conditions

**Source**: <mention-page url="...">Database Migration Proposal</mention-page>

### Historical Context

We successfully migrated from Redis to Memcached in 2023, which took 6 weeks. Key learnings:
- Underestimated application code changes (3 weeks instead of 1 week)
- Rollback plan was crucial when we discovered compatibility issues
- Parallel running period (dual writes) was essential for safe migration

**Source**: <mention-page url="...">Previous Migration Post-mortem</mention-page>

## Decision Required

**Question**: Which database migration strategy should we adopt?

**Timeline**: Need decision by end of week to include in Q4 planning

**Impact**: 
- Engineering team (4-8 weeks of work)
- Application architecture
- Operations & monitoring
- Future feature development velocity

## Options Analysis

### Option A: Stay on MongoDB with Optimizations

**Description**: Invest in MongoDB performance tuning, add indexes, upgrade to latest version, implement better query patterns.

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ No migration complexity
- ‚úÖ Team familiar with MongoDB
- ‚úÖ Can implement immediately
- ‚úÖ Lower risk
- ‚úÖ Estimated 2 weeks effort

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Doesn't solve fundamental schema flexibility issues
- ‚ùå Still limited transaction support
- ‚ùå Performance improvements may be temporary
- ‚ùå Continues technical debt accumulation

**Cost/Effort**: 2 weeks engineering + $5K/year additional MongoDB infrastructure

**Risk**: Medium - Improvements may not be sufficient

**Source**: <mention-page url="...">Migration Options Analysis</mention-page>

### Option B: Migrate to PostgreSQL

**Description**: Full migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL. Redesign schema with proper constraints, implement dual-write period, then cut over.

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Solves schema consistency issues
- ‚úÖ Full ACID transactions
- ‚úÖ Better performance for relational queries
- ‚úÖ Lower long-term complexity
- ‚úÖ Industry standard, easier hiring

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå High migration effort (6-8 weeks)
- ‚ùå Requires schema redesign
- ‚ùå Application code changes extensive
- ‚ùå Risk of data loss during migration
- ‚ùå Downtime required (4-6 hours estimated)

**Cost/Effort**: 8 weeks engineering + $8K migration costs - $15K/year MongoDB savings = net $7K/year savings

**Risk**: High - Complex migration, application changes required

**Recommendation**: ‚úÖ **Favored by engineering team**

**Source**: <mention-page url="...">Database Migration Proposal</mention-page>

### Option C: Hybrid Approach

**Description**: Keep MongoDB for document-heavy data (logs, analytics), migrate transactional data to PostgreSQL. Run both databases.

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Phased migration (lower risk)
- ‚úÖ Use best tool for each data type
- ‚úÖ Can migrate incrementally
- ‚úÖ Smaller initial scope (4 weeks)

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Increased operational complexity
- ‚ùå Two databases to maintain
- ‚ùå Data consistency between databases challenging
- ‚ùå Higher infrastructure costs
- ‚ùå Complex application logic

**Cost/Effort**: 4 weeks initial + ongoing complexity + $10K/year additional infrastructure

**Risk**: Medium - Operational complexity increases

**Source**: <mention-page url="...">Migration Options Analysis</mention-page>

### Option D: Do Nothing

**Description**: Accept current performance and continue with MongoDB as-is.

**Implications**:
- Performance continues to degrade
- Technical debt increases
- Feature development slows
- Customer experience suffers
- Eventually forced into emergency migration

**Not recommended**

## Discussion Topics

### Technical Feasibility
1. Can we achieve < 4 hours downtime for Option B?
2. What's the rollback plan if PostgreSQL migration fails?
3. How do we handle data migration for 500GB?
4. Schema design - what constraints do we need?

### Business Impact
5. What's the customer impact of 4-6 hours downtime?
6. Can we schedule migration during low-traffic period?
7. How does this affect Q4 feature roadmap?
8. Cost-benefit analysis over 2-year horizon?

### Risk Management
9. What are the biggest risks with Option B?
10. How do we test thoroughly before cutover?
11. What's the rollback procedure and time?
12. Do we have necessary expertise on team?

### Timeline & Resources
13. Can we allocate 2 engineers full-time for 8 weeks?
14. Do we need external consultants?
15. What's the impact on other Q4 projects?
16. When could we realistically complete this?

## Decision Framework

**Evaluation criteria**:
1. **Performance improvement**: Will this solve our performance issues?
2. **Technical debt**: Does this reduce or increase complexity?
3. **Risk**: What's the probability and impact of failure?
4. **Cost**: Total cost of ownership (effort + infrastructure)
5. **Timeline**: Can we complete in Q4?
6. **Reversibility**: Can we roll back if needed?
